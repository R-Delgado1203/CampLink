# CampLink

CampLink is a LinkedIn/directory type application for graduates of the UofA BootCamp program.

## What Does CampLink Do?

CampLink will efficiently group together grads from each cohort (into a database) and display:

```
Name
Email
Github link
Portfolio
Favorite Languages
Current Job
Looking to hire?
Looking for work?
```
   

The user will be able to customize their profile with:
```
Profile Picture
About Me
Project Spotlights
Collaborations/References
```

The initial sign-up information and additional info (profile picture, about me, etc.) will be joined together on completion of the profile.

Users will be able to view other users sorted by
```
Favorite languages
Cohort Year
Staff
```


Invite links will be set out to graduating classes of the Bootcamp.  Previous graduates will be tracked down and invited to join.



Future Goals
```
Create a message board or chat service within CampLink
User Authentication
```


And if you have any suggestions or ideas let them be known. Better now than later

### Prerequisites

1) URL link to CampLink

```
Preferably, use same e-mail address used for BootCampSpot
```
